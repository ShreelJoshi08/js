<!-- Problem Definition
You are working on modernizing a legacy JavaScript application.
Implement key ECMAScript 6 features like let, const, arrow functions,
spread operator, etc., for improved performance and maintainability.
Key Questions to be evaluated during/after Implementation
1. Why are ES6 features preferred in modern JavaScript?
2. How do arrow functions improve readability and scope management?
3. What are the advantages of using Promises and Classes?
Supplementary Problems –
• Convert traditional functions into arrow functions
• Replace var declarations with let/const
Key Skills to be addressed –
• ES6 syntax and semantics, modern JS paradigms
Applications –
• Frontend SPAs, real-time applications, APIs -->

            const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
            const array2 = [4, 5, 6];

                }, 2000);
